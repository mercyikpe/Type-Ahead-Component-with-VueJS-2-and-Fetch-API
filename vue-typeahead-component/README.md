# vue-typeahead-component

> In this tutorial we are going to build simple VueJS 2 Typeahead Component.We won’t use any libraries such as Axios, jQuery or VueResource - instead we are going to use Fetch API, that’s built into the browser.Usage of Fetch API is pretty straightforward.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
